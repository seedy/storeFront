# BigCommerce Front-End Candidate Assignments
This ZIP includes a number of assets, sample screens and instructions for two separate assignments, depending on the
role you're applying for with BigCommerce. They are designed to let you showcase the breadth and depth of your
front-end skills. Please complete the assignment that is relevant to the role you've applied for. If you're unsure
which one that is, please contact the recruiter who sent you this assignment for clarification.

* [APP.md](./APP.md): for engineering candidates, this involves creating a single-page application using MVC principles.
* [RESPONSIVE.md](./RESPONSIVE.md): for UI candidates, this involves recreating several screens using responsive
  design principles.

**Note:** Should you wish to complete _both_ assignments in combination, that is entirely at your discretion, but there
is no requirement to do so. Your assignment will be judged primarily on how well you completed the requirements for the
relevant task.
