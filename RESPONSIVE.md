# Responsive Storefront

### Question
Using HTML, CSS and the supplied media, recreate the screens below in a responsive manner.
* The storefront consists of three main screens: a category list page, a product details page, and a cart page.
* None of the pages require any behaviour; they are completely static.
* You are free to create 3 separate static HTML files, or to use any tools/methods you deem appropriate to reduce code
  duplication.
* You are free to use whatever frameworks you deem appropriate, but you should justify your choice in the application's
  README.
* You are free to use any CSS pre/post processors, build tools or methodologies (SASS, LESS, Autoprefixer, PostCSS).
* You are free to nominate the breakpoint at which the page transitions from mobile to desktop layouts. Please justify
  your choices for each breakpoint in your code comments.
* Your assignment will be judged on structure, clarity of code, reusability and extensibility, accessibility, etc.
